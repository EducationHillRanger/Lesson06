            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>My name is Jamin Debu, and welcome to my blog page!</p>

            <h2>What I do currently</h2>
            <p>Right now I am in 10th grade. I go to Legacy homeschool cooperative and Heritage homeschool cooperative, which are both 1-day-a-week schools. But I get just as much homework as a regular school would give!</p>
            <p>Homework is what I fill most of my time with. This page, for example, was a homework assignment- It took me about two hours to complete! The homework I enjoy most of all is programming- I program in Python, Java and HTML/CSS, which is what I used to create this webpage.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I go for runs, ride my bike if the weather is good and play chess. I also have a guitar studio.</p>

            <h2>What I am working towards</h2>
            <p>I am working towards completing high school early, so I am enrolling in a running start program. I plan to work towards degrees in Applied Mathematics and Computer science. </p>
            <p>This should prepare me for a career in actuarial sciences, which are careers closely related to that of consultants.</p>
